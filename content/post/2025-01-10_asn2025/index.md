Reflections from the ASN Conference in Pacific Grove, CA
The American Society of Naturalists (ASN) conference at the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove, California, was an incredible experience. I had the chance to attend with two members from the MEEP Lab, Ashley and Richard, as well as our honorary member, Leo. The location was absolutely perfect—those beautiful coastal views set the stage for a conference full of engaging science and meaningful connections.
Kat gave an excellent lightning talk, presenting her research in a fast-paced, yet captivating way. It was exciting to see her share her work with such an engaged and dynamic audience.
The conference this year brought together a diverse group of researchers across various fields of ecology, evolution, behavior, genetics, and more. The talks were fascinating and sparked lots of conversation, and I had the chance to reconnect with colleagues while making new connections. Ashley, Richard, and Leo all left the conference with fresh ideas that will no doubt inspire our work at the MEEP Lab.
In addition to the great science, the setting provided plenty of opportunities for social exchange and reflection. With the conference taking place in such a scenic location, it was easy to appreciate the beauty of the natural world while discussing the latest research. We even had the chance to think about further networking possibilities, like birdwatching or kayaking in the nearby Elkhorn Slough.
Overall, it was an inspiring and rewarding experience—great talks, beautiful views, and valuable connections that will keep influencing our research back at the lab. Looking forward to putting some of what we learned into practice!
