The Lewis & Clark Natural History Club invited me to be a part of their 6th Annual Moss Appreciation Week, and it was a fantastic experience! I kicked off my involvement by leading a moss walk on campus, where we explored the diversity and ecological importance of mosses in our Pacific Northwest habitat. We had an enthusiastic group, and it was wonderful to see people connect with the mosses growing right under their feet.
I also had the honor of giving the keynote lecture titled "Unlike a Rolling Stone: The Secret Life of Moss That Grows Under Rocks," where I shared the fascinating ways in which mosses thrive in hidden, rocky environments. These hardy plants have unique survival strategies that make them resilient in even the harshest conditions, and it was a joy to explain their role in ecosystems, from their interactions with moisture to their contributions to biodiversity.
Throughout the week, there were tons of other moss-themed events that added to the celebration. Some highlights included:
Moss Petting Zoo: A hands-on experience where attendees could explore moss in all its textures, presented by the Portland State University Herbarium.
Moss Murmurs Ear Forest Installation: An interactive, immersive experience featuring soundscapes and voice performances.
Gastropod Derby: A fun, competitive event with a moss twist!
Terrarium Workshop: Participants created their own mini moss habitats with supplies provided by Robin Fujita ’18.
The event wrapped up with a Moss Walk, which I had the pleasure of leading, where we identified and discussed different moss species that play critical roles in maintaining the ecosystem.
It was a week filled with creativity, education, and, of course, a deep appreciation for moss! Thanks to the Natural History Club and everyone who made this week memorable!

It was truly a fantastic week celebrating moss in all its forms—thanks again to everyone who participated and made it so special!
