The Lewis & Clark Natural History Club invited me to be a part of their 6th Annual Moss Appreciation Week, and it was a fantastic experience! 
I kicked off my involvement by leading a moss walk on campus, where we explored the diversity and ecological importance of mosses in the Pacific Northwest habitat. 

We had an enthusiastic group, and it was wonderful to see people connect with the mosses growing right under their feet.

Throughout the week, there were tons of other moss-themed events that added to the celebration. 

Some highlights included:
- Moss Petting Zoo: A hands-on experience where attendees could explore moss in all its textures, presented by the Portland State University Herbarium.
- Moss Murmurs Ear Forest Installation: An interactive, immersive experience featuring soundscapes and voice performances.
- Gastropod Derby: A fun, competitive event with a moss twist!
- Terrarium Workshop: Participants created their own mini moss habitats with supplies provided by Robin Fujita â€™18.

The event wrapped up with the keynote lecture, which I also had the honor of giving, titled "Unlike a Rolling Stone: The Secret Life of Moss That Grows Under Rocks," where I shared the story of hypolithic moss. 

It was truly a fantastic week celebrating moss in all its forms.
Thank you to the Lewis & Clark Natural History Club and everyone who made this week memorable!
