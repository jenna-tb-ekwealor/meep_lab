MEEP Lab undergraduates **Kaylee Macomb**, **David Marczak**, **Vinusha Bandara**, and **Faizaan Shaikh** presented a research poster at the 2025 SFSU Summer Research Symposium, mentored by graduate student .[**Richard Baker-Strader**](../authors/EmoryAdelman/). 

The group worked on a comparative genomics project investigating the genomic structure of the moss *Syntrichia princeps*, using synteny analysis to test whether both male and female sex chromosomes are retained in the genome.

The event brought together undergraduate researchers from across the College of Science & Engineering. It was a great chance for the team to share their work, field questions from the audience, and see what other research is happening across campus.

Great job, team!
