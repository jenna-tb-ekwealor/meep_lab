The MEEP lab had the great pleasure of visiting the California Academy of Sciences [**herbarium collection**](https://www.calacademy.org/scientists/botany-collections) in November! Our stellar tour guide, [**CAS Botanist Isaac Lichter-Marck**](https://www.calacademy.org/staff/ibss/botany/isaac-lichter-marck), gave us a peek behind the curtain of the sixth largest collection in the United States.

The MEEP Lab enjoyed meeting the botany staff at CAS; [**Ricardo Kriebel**](https://www.calacademy.org/staff/ibss/botany/ricardo-kriebel) shared his beautifully crafted botanical posters and was kind enough to give each member of the lab a copy to take home, thank you Ricardo!
