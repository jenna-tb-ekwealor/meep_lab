Welcome [Ashley Meinke](https://meep-lab.com/author/ashley-meinke/) to the lab!
*Round of applause!* 
Ashley is working on data analysis, ranging from network analyses of metabolites involved in stress tolerance, to linear modeling physiology metrics, to phylogenetic modeling the evolution of stress tolerance---all in *Syntrichia!*
She's well on her way to being a true data and coding wizard. 
Stay tuned!
