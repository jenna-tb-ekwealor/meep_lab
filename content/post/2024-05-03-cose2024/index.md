title: College of Science and Engineering Student Project Showcase 2024
date: 2024-05-03
summary: Ashley won 3rd place in the Environment category of the SFSU College of Science and Engineering 2024 Student Project Showcase!
---

Undergraduate MEEP Lab researcher [Ashley Meinke](../../../author/ashley-meinke/) presented a poster in SFSU's College of Science and Engineering (CoSE) 2024 Student Project Showcase. 
This is a huge event with over 200 posters from schools and departments including: Biology (Ashley's department), Chemistry & Biochemistry, Computer Science, Engineering, Environment, Mathematics, Physics & Astronomy, and Psychology. 
Poster and Project categories were further broken down by topic, and Ashley presented in the Environment category. 

Each category awards 1st, 2nd, and 3rd prize awards, and each poster is visited by up to 3 judges who score the presentation based on a set of 10 questions on the appearance, presentation, and significance of the research.  
Ashley won 3rd place! I (PI Jenna) was a judge in a different category so I know how fierce the competition was--the presentations were truly excellent, it was hard to narrow down to the 3 best, even with our scores tallied.
I am sure the Environment category was the same. 

Congratulations, Ashley!

Stop by Hensill Hall 4th floor case (outside of the lab in HH 405) to see the poster for yourself.
