Welcome [Kat McCullough](https://meep-lab.com/author/KatrinaMcCullough/) to the lab!

*Round of applause!* 

Kat, a fabulous fungi-fanatic, is meeting us in the middle and studying photosynthetic fungi... AKA lichen! ;) 
She is working to understand the ecology of epiphytic lichens on coyote brush (*Baccharis pilularis*) on San Bruno Mountain. 
Stay tuned!
