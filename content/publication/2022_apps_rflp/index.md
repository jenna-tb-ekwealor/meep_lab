abstract: 'Premise: In dioicous mosses, sex is determined by a single U (female, ♀) or V (male, ♂) chromosome. Although a 1 : 1 sex ratio is expected following meiosis, phenotypic sex ratios based on the production of gametangia are often female-biased. The dryland moss <i>Syntrichia caninervis</i> (Pottiaceae) is notable for its low frequency of sex expression and strong phenotypic female bias. Here we present a technique to determine genotypic sex in a single shoot of S. caninervis, and report results of a case study examining genotypic and phenotypic sex ratios. Methods: We reanalyzed 271 non-expressing gametophyte shoots from a previous study on <i>S. caninervis</i> sex expression across microhabitats using a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method. Results: We recovered a genotypic sex ratio in non-expressing shoots of 18.4♀ : 1♂, which exceeds the female bias of the phenotypic ratio (5.3♀ : 1♂; P = 0.013). We also found that the distribution of male and female genotypes across microsites with different levels of sun exposure was not predicted by patterns of sex expression in these microsites. Discussion: These findings contribute to our understanding of how the environment may modulate sex ratios in <i>S. caninervis</i>, either through its direct influence on sex expression or through selection on genotypes with particular sex expression phenotypes.'
summary: 'We present a technique to determine genotypic sex in the highly clonal <i>Syntrichia caninervis</i>, and the results of a case study examining genotypic and phenotypic sex ratios.'
