abstract: |
  Desiccation-tolerant bryophytes often encounter humid air prior to liquid precipitation during rehydration in nature—a condition largely underrepresented in desiccation physiology studies. We investigated how prehydration affects regeneration in shoots of the desert moss Syntrichia caninervis that had remained desiccated for 17 years. Shoot tips were rehydrated either directly with liquid water or after exposure to humid air (prehydration) lasting from less than an hour to seven days, followed by liquid water. Direct rehydration yielded ~50 % viability, whereas prehydration increased viability to ~85 %. Notably, exposure to humid air for the first hour—raising shoot water content to 20 % dry mass (DM) at 91 % relative humidity—already conferred significant benefits. Water content rose from 5 % to ~100 % after 24–48 hours of prehydration (full turgor reached at 350 % DM). Prehydration of 8 hours or more reduced leaf damage (except at 7 days), enabled shoots to regenerate 4.5 days earlier, and produced 2.5 times more regenerative points than direct water exposure. These results suggest that reaching full water saturation (100 % DM) isn't necessary to improve survival and regeneration—partial prehydration to 20 % DM is sufficient.
summary: |
  Partial prehydration of desiccated Syntrichia caninervis (as low as 20 % dry mass) significantly enhances revival outcomes compared to direct watering. Benefits include higher viability (~85 %), reduced leaf damage, faster regeneration (by ~4.5 days), and more regenerative points (~2.5×). Maximum hydration isn’t required—moderate humidity exposure suffices.
