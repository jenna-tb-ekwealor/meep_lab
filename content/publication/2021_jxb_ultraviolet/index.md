abstract: 'Plants in dryland ecosystems experience extreme daily and seasonal fluctuations in light, temperature, and water availability. We used an *in situ* field experiment to uncover the effects of natural and reduced levels of ultraviolet radiation (UV) on maximum PSII quantum efficiency (*F*v/*F*m), relative abundance of photosynthetic pigments and antioxidants, and the transcriptome in the desiccation-tolerant desert moss *Syntrichia caninervis*. We tested the hypotheses that: (i) *S. caninervis* plants undergo sustained thermal quenching of light [non-photochemical quenching (NPQ)] while desiccated and after rehydration; (ii) a reduction of UV will result in improved recovery of Fv/Fm; but (iii) 1 year of UV removal will de-harden plants and increase vulnerability to UV damage, indicated by a reduction in *F*v/*F*m. All field-collected plants had extremely low *F*v/*F*m after initial rehydration but recovered over 8 d in lab-simulated winter conditions. UV-filtered plants had lower *F*v/*F*m during recovery, higher concentrations of photoprotective pigments and antioxidants such as zeaxanthin and tocopherols, and lower concentrations of neoxanthin and Chl b than plants exposed to near natural UV levels. Field-grown S. caninervis underwent sustained NPQ that took days to relax and for efficient photosynthesis to resume. Reduction of solar UV radiation adversely affected recovery of *F*v/*F*m following rehydration.'
