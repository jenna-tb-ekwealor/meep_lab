This interdisciplinary project addresses the environmental justice implications of airborne dust in Californiaâ€™s Central Valley. Students will investigate the biotic and abiotic components of dust, including microbial and fungal content, and link these data to land degradation and health risks in vulnerable communities. The work involves field sampling, indoor and outdoor air monitoring, DNA extraction, and quantitative PCR to detect pathogens like *Coccidioides*. Students will gain experience at the interface of environmental biology, public health, and community-engaged research, contributing to data-driven interventions for health equity.
