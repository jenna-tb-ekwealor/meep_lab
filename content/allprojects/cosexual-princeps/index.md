title: "*Syntrichia princeps* is a cosexual moss species, meaning it produces both male and female reproductive structures on the same individual. This project investigates the genomic basis and reproductive biology of cosexuality, particularly the role of sex chromosomes in development and gene regulation. Students will conduct fieldwork to collect samples, perform molecular analyses to investigate sex-linked genes, and contribute to efforts to understand reproductive diversity in mosses. This project offers an entry point into plant reproductive evolution, with opportunities for both field and laboratory research."
