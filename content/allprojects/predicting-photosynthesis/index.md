title: "This project investigates how the desert moss *Syntrichia caninervis*, a dominant biocrust species in California’s deserts, responds to climate variation through changes in photosynthesis and desiccation tolerance. Students will help explore whether this moss uses sustained non-photochemical quenching (NPQ), a key photoprotective mechanism, to survive seasonal drought, and whether differences in photosynthetic traits arise from phenotypic plasticity or genetic adaptation. The work includes quarterly field sampling from desert sites across California and physiological lab work including chlorophyll fluorescence and pigment analysis. Common garden experiments will help separate genetic and environmental drivers of variation. The project provides a platform to study plant resilience to drought and light stress, and to inform desert restoration and conservation strategies."
