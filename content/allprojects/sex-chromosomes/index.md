### Sex chromosome evolution in mosses

This project explores intragenomic conflict, competition between genes within the same genome, in the context of moss reproductive biology and sex chromosome evolution. Mosses offer a unique and powerful model for studying conflict due to their haploid maternal generation and distinct U/V sex chromosomes. Students will investigate signatures of conflict through transcriptomic and genomic analyses, including allele-specific expression, imprinting, and miRNA regulation. Comparative analyses between species with different mating systems will help assess how reproductive strategies shape conflict-related traits. This project combines evolutionary biology, gene regulation, and cutting-edge genomics to establish mosses as a novel model for understanding conflict within genomes.
