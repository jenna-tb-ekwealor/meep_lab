title: When desiccation-tolerant mosses rehydrate, they release leachate, compounds that may serve as food for microbial communities. This project explores how different microbes within biological soil crusts (biocrusts) respond to and partition these compounds. Students will analyze leachate chemistry and test its effects on microbial cultures, potentially identifying symbiotic interactions. This project includes experimental design, microbial culturing, and molecular biology methods such as DNA extraction and sequencing. It is ideal for students interested in microbial ecology and moss-microbe interactions.
