title: This project investigates microbial communities associated with *Syntrichia* mosses and their potential functional roles in host physiology. Focusing on groups like *Methylobacteria*, students will use transcriptomic and metagenomic data to assess microbial gene expression related to plant hormone biosynthesis and stress response. This work combines bioinformatics, microbial ecology, and plant-microbe interaction studies. There are opportunities for both computational and wet lab work depending on the student's interest.
