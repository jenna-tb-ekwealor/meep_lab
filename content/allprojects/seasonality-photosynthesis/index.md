# Seasonality of photosynthetic activity in desert *Syntrichia caninervis*

Desert mosses like *Syntrichia caninervis* experience highly variable environmental conditions throughout the year. This project examines how seasonal changes in precipitation and temperature affect photosynthetic performance and photoprotection, with a focus on NPQ dynamics. Students will use chlorophyll fluorescence and pigment assays to monitor seasonal shifts in photosynthetic traits and may conduct controlled experiments to distinguish between plastic and genetically fixed responses. The goal is to better understand how desert biocrust mosses balance desiccation tolerance and light protection across seasons, with implications for climate change adaptation and ecosystem restoration.
