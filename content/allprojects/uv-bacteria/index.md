title: Some bacteria associated with moss tissues may help protect their hosts from UV radiation by producing UV-absorbing compounds. This project will use metagenomics and transcriptomics to identify bacterial taxa capable of producing compounds like scytonemin or MAAs. Students will assess microbial community composition and gene expression, linking microbial function with host stress mitigation. The project is ideal for students interested in functional microbiology, symbiosis, and environmental stress resilience.
