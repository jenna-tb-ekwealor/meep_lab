### Comparative and functional microbiomes of biological soil crusts

This project compares microbial community composition and function in biological soil crusts across environmental gradients, including arid, temperate, and urban ecosystems. Using existing metagenomic data and new sampling, students will identify microbial taxa and functional pathways involved in nutrient cycling and stress adaptation. Special attention will be given to microbes associated with mosses and their responses to “bryotic pulses” of hydration. This project emphasizes computational skills, microbial ecology, and environmental change.
