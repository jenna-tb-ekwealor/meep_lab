This project investigates cold and freeze tolerance in *Syntrichia norvegica*, a high-elevation moss potentially capable of photosynthesizing under snow. Students will explore how photosynthetic activity varies with temperature, light quality, and snow cover through lab and/or field experiments. Experiments may include measuring chlorophyll fluorescence, assessing freeze-thaw survival, or monitoring metabolic indicators. A newly-sequenced genome for this species opens opportunities for RNA-seq and comparative genomic work. This research contributes to our understanding of cold adaptation and energy balance in overwintering plants. Students can tailor the project toward molecular or ecological approaches depending on their interests.
