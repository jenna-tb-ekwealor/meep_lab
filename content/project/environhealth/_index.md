This interdisciplinary research connects ecology with public health, focusing on issues like airborne dust exposure, land degradation, and microbial risks in marginalized communities. We partner with local organizations to co-produce data and design interventions that promote environmental justice. These projects combine field sampling, molecular analysis, and geospatial tools to link biological research with real-world impact.
