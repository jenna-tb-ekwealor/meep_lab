 summary: Projects focusing on how mosses and biocrust organisms physiologically respond to environmental stress, seasonal change, and water availability.
  projects:
    - Freeze tolerance and winter photosynthesis in Syntrichia norvegica
    - Predicting photosynthetic responses to climate change in California desert mosses
    - UV “sunscreen” in desert Syntrichia caninervis
    - Seasonality of photosynthetic activity in desert Syntrichia caninervis
    - Fog as a water source: moss ecology and physiology on San Bruno Mountain
