We study the microbial communities living in and around mosses, from UV-protective bacteria to microbes that activate during hydration pulses. These projects explore plant-microbe interactions in biocrust ecosystems, focusing on nutrient cycling, stress tolerance, and community assembly. Using culturing, sequencing, and metagenomics, we uncover how symbiosis contributes to resilience in dryland environments.
