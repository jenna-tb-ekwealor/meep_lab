We investigate the physiological strategies that allow mosses and biocrust organisms to endure extreme drought, freezing temperatures, and intense solar radiation. From desiccation tolerance to photoprotection and seasonal plasticity, these projects explore how plants manage water, light, and energy across time and space. Our work integrates field monitoring, lab experiments, and physiological modeling to understand resilience and vulnerability in the face of climate change.


**Projects in this theme:**

- [Freeze tolerance and winter photosynthesis in *Syntrichia norvegica*](/allprojects/freeze-tolerance/)
- [Fog as a water source for bryophytes and lichens](/allprojects/fog/)
- [UV “sunscreen” in desert *Syntrichia caninervis*](/allprojects/uv-sunscreen/)
