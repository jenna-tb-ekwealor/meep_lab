Hey y’all! I’m Abbey and I’m a post-bac scholar in the MEEP lab as part of the Bay Area RaMP for Microbiome Sciences at UC Berkeley. 
I’m from Fort Worth Texas and recently graduated from the University of North Texas with my BS in Ecology. 
I’m brand new to the Bay and super excited to explore new research techniques in a brand new environment. 
I plan to pursue a PhD in biology and I’m super passionate about community ecology and all things computational/stats. 
In my free time I love watching movies, sewing and baking!
