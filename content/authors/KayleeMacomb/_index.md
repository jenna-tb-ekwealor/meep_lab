Hi my name is Kaylee and I am a fourth year studying Biology with a concentration in Ecology. 
I am from San Mateo here in the Bay Area. 
I am a current URISE scholar and participated in the PINC summer program in the MEEP lab as well! 
My project/research interests include public, environmental, and community health, data analysis, and bioinformatics.
