Hi, my name is Kelley Brown. I’m a first-generation student from Los Angeles, but the Bay Area has really become my second home; I’ve grown so used to life here that I can’t imagine going back. I earned my B.S. in Evolution, Ecology, and Conservation, and I’m now working on my M.S. in Integrative Biology. My passion lies in stewardship and conservation, and I’ve had the opportunity to intern with the National Park Service, which really solidified my interest in pursuing a career in that field.
Outside of school and research, I love birdwatching and going on hikes, which lets me connect with the landscapes and wildlife that inspire my work. When I’m not outdoors, I enjoy going to concerts, hanging out in the Mission, styling/coloring my friends' hair, and saying yes to spontaneous adventures, especially retail therapy with the girls!
