## Hello bryophyte buddies! 

My name is Emory Adelman, and I am a Cell and Molecular Biology Major with a Minor in Computing Applications (thank you PINC!)
I started College as a Nursing major, and have two Associateâ€™s Degrees (in Public Health and Pre-Nursing) from Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo. 
Being from SLO, I love the outdoors. 
I cannot choose between the beach and the mountains, especially since learning about how important all organisms are in those areas, with learning more about moss ecology! 
I am honored to be a part of the MEEP Lab as a Senior at San Francisco State. 
I am currently working on making paired-end alignments with Bowtie2 and Geneious Prime, to delve into the mysteries behind *Syntrichia princeps*, a model organism that is hermaphroditic, and because of this may have abnormal sex chromosomes and ploidy for a moss species. 
I hope to seek more information on this and other characteristics of the moss!
