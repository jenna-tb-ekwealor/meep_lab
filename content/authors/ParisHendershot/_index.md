Hello! 
My name is Paris Hendershot and I am a first year Cell and Molecular Biology masters student. 
I am originally from Huntington Beach California, but I studied and received my B.S. in Biology at UC Santa Cruz. 
Additionally, I interned  with the Treehouse Undergraduate Bioinformatics Immersion (TUBI) to analyze pediatric cancer genomes. 
I am passionate about many subjects in biology such as genetics, microbiology, conservation, infectious diseases just to name a few! Outside of academics I love to read, go thrifting with friends, take naps, and hike.
